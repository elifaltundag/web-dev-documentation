# Documentation: Web Development with HTML, CSS & JS

## About the Project
This project is a mixture of technical documentation, guide and summary of my front-end development journey. It covers some essential HTML, CSS and JS subjects.
It is part of the Responsive Web Design Certification projects of freeCodeCamp, you can access the details [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-technical-documentation-page-project/build-a-technical-documentation-page) {:target="_blank"}.

### Status : On-going
An older version is upload for the certification. I keep adding new content and improve the design and code.

### Objectives
